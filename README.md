This is the definition of Romanticism Novalis gives in §31 of his Allgemeine Brouillon, in Gerhard Schulz, ed., Novalis Werke, 3rd ed. (Munich: Beck, 1987), 455: “The time of universal anarchy— lawlessness—freedom—nature in its natural state—the time before the world (the state). Pre-world time provides as it were the dispersed traces of post-world time. [...] Chaos is creation fulfilled. The future world is rational chaos, self-permeating chaos, chaos or ∞.”
